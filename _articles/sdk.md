<h2>4. Getting Started</h2><div id="getting-started"></div>

Before starting to use the Plex-SDK you have to install it on your project, the easiest way to do it is by installing through Node Package Manager(NPM).
First, run the command below within the context of your project:

```
npm install everis-plexsdk
```

After executing the previous command, you are able to import the SDK into your project for executing it, just typing in the below command

```
const plex = require(‘everis-plexsdk’)
```

From now on, you are ready to start using Plex-SDK in your project.

<h2>5. General API</h2><div id="api"></div>

This section introduces the main methods of the Plex SDK and their functionality.

<h3>5.1 Health-check calls</h3>

The objective of this feature as its name suggests is to bring some kind of information that clients of the platform can understand as its entire park of devices are going on not just in the current moment but also in the past with our logging system. This functionality is enabled when you invoke method bellow. You can verify the health status of the devices at everis Plex Platform.

```
plex.init()
```


<h3>5.2 sendMsg Method(deprecated)</h3>

The main objective of this method is to send a message containing an image data to everis Plex Platform. The img parameter should be a base64-encoded image.

```
(async) sendMsg(img)
```

Send an image <strong>(img)</strong> to everis Plex Platform.

<strong>Parameters:</strong>

| Name | Type | Description |
|-------|--------|---------|

As shown above, the method receives just one parameter, this parameter is attached as a payload of POST request.

<h3>5.3 init() Method</h3>

This method is responsible for starting health check service in software using SDK. It is just a wrapper around healthCheck().


```
init()
```


Call this method to start to use the Plex health-check system.

<h3>5.4 imgRecognition(img)</h3>

This method receives an img as parameter. everis Plex Platform is going to use some face recognition engine to try to detect a person in img. Client needs to use some recognition phyapp  in Plex Journey to perform it.

| callback | function | This is an function in order to receive return |


<h2>6. Authentication API</h2><div id="api-auth"></div>

The main objective of this section is to bring some light about authentication in the everis Plex Platform.
Before starting to authenticate in everis Plex Platform you need to contact the Plex team in order to get a CA, Client certificate and a valid ClientKEY.
As soon as you have this information in hands, you can go ahead with the authentication process.
The below is the only method necessary to authenticate in everis Plex Platform.

<h3>6.1 Auth(rootCa, clientCert, clientKey)</h3>

This method receives three parameters and tries to authenticate in everis Plex Platform.

```
auth(rootCA, clientCert, clientKey)
```


More  information about the parameters, please see below.

<strong>Parameters:</strong>

| Name | Type | Description |
|-------|--------|---------|
| rootCA | URI | The absolute path to RootCA certificate |
| clientCert | URI | The absolute path to Client certificate |
| clientKey | String | String with password key |

As you can see below. In the last three lines we are referencing the parameters of the .env file in order to keep the project better organized.

```
require(‘dotenv’).config()

sdk.auth(proccess.env.ROOT_CA,
                 proccess.env.CLIENT_CERT, 
                 proccess.env.CLIENT_KEY) 
```

<h2>7. Estimator API</h2><div id="api-estimatior"></div>

Several Plex features get started by receiving some details about personal characteristics or even a person's recognition for solving this kind of problems; we have added an Estimator API that helps construct these solutions.

<h3>7.1 verifyFaceEmotions(checkFaceEmotions)</h3>

This method checks face emotions in image. Please, check structure of this method, below:

```
verifyEmotions(checkFaceEmotions)
```

This method receives a boolean value to verify or to bypass these characteristics.

<strong>Parameters:</strong>

| Name | Type | Description |
|-------|--------|---------|
| checkFaceEmotions | boolean | true or false |

<h3>7.2 verifyFaceAttributes(checkFaceAttributes)</h3>

As named this method is responsible for configuring face attributes checking. This method receives a Boolean as parameter true to enable or false to bypass this checking.

```
verifyFaceAttributes(checkFaceAttributes)
```
This method receives a boolean value to verify or to bypass these characteristics.

<strong>Parameters:</strong>

| Name | Type | Description |
|-------|--------|---------|
| checkFaceAttributes | boolean | true or false |

<h3>7.3 buildEstimatorInstance (schema)</h3>

Method used to generate a schema or payload instance. This method receives a string to generate a schema or nothing to create an instance object.

```
buildEstimatorInstance(schema)
```

After calling <strong>verifyFaceAttributes</strong>, we need to call <strong>verifyFaceEmotions</strong> to generate a schema or payload instance. This method receives a string with a JSON Schema to generate a schema or not to create an instance object.

<strong>Parameters:</strong>

| Name | Type | Description |
|-------|--------|---------|
| schema | string | JSON Schema |

<h3>7.4 createSchema()</h3>

This is a simple method, it does not receive any parameter, just call this method in a fluent interface but we will speak about it in the next section.

```
createSchema()
```


After calling <strong>buildEstimatorInstance</strong>, we need to call this method to create the schema.

<h3>7.5 build()</h3>

This method should be invoked just if we need to create an instance object after calling buildEstimatorInstance() without parameters, to create an instance object.

```
build()
```

<h2>8. Fluent Interface and Estimator API and its case of using</h2><div id="api-use"></div>

This section explains how to use the Fluent Interface and Estimator API included in Plex SDK. The Estimator API was built using the Fluent Pattern, which consists in a chain of methods calling each other, basically. For a better understanding of this pattern, please refer to [Fluent Interface](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/fluentinterface).

<h3>8.1 Fluent Pattern in Estimator API</h3>

In this subsection, we explain as a estimator api makes use of the fluent interface pattern to turn the api more readable and developer-friendly.

As we can see in the below snippet of code, it sounds as if you are answering questions and in the final step you get what you want.

```
const schema = EstimatorBuilder
                    .verifyCheckFaceAttributes(true)
                    .verifyCheckFaceEmotions(true)
                    .buildEstimatorInstance()
                    .createSchema()
```

We have two different uses of estimator API in the snippet above. Starting in line 10 until the 14th line, we are creating a schema of this object.  Still in the snippet, from the 16 to 20th line we are creating an object instance. Anyway, the foundation is the same, if you have any doubts about methods and its use, check the sections about Estimator API, in the previous sections.

     	console.log(resp)
})

```
<h2>11. TUIO API</h2><div id="api-tuio"></div>

According to TUIO Official Website (tuio.org), “TUIO is an open framework that defines a common protocol and API for tangible multitouch surfaces. The TUIO protocol allows the transmission of an abstract description of interactive surfaces, including touch events and tangible object states. This protocol encodes control data from a tracker application (e.g. based on computer vision) and sends it to any client application that is capable of decoding the protocol. There exists a growing number of TUIO enabled tracker applications and TUIO client libraries for various programming environments, as well as applications that support the protocol”. This section explains the methods which can be used to detect TUIO messages through Plex SDK. 

<h3>11.1 Elements</h3>


There are two elements which can be detected: cursors, that represends selectors like a finger, for example, and objects, that represends surfaces with position, size and rotation.


| Cursor | Description |
|-|-|
| si | Section ID (everytime that a cursor is removed and added, the section ID changes) |
|   ci   | Cursor ID (unique identifier of the cursor) |
| xp | X-axis position |
| yp | Y-axis position |

<br>

| Object | Description |
|-|-|
| xp | X-axis position |
| yp | Y-axis position |
| si | Section ID |
| sym | Symbol ID (unique identifier of an object) |
| a | Angle of rotation |



<h3>11.2 tuio.init(host, srcPort, destPort)</h3>

This method lets you initialize a TUIO client. A client receives TUIO UDP signals through the port defined by srcPort and makes this available through a websocket server with host defined by host param and port defined by destPort. This server can be listened for any frontend application or through using the plex TUIO events methods.

```
tuio.init(host, srcPort, destPort)
```

Initialize a TUIO client.

<strong>Parameters:</strong>

| Name | Type | Description |
